\f0\fs24 \cf0 What I need to accomplish in order to reach the alpha stage, I need to fix a glitch in the slide bar. Sliding the bar up is fine but after sliding it back down, the light will flicker from high to low. I have an idea on how to fix it. I also need to put in more pages to hold all my content. I need to figure out a way to make ajax work on a mobile device so a user can signup and login. Lastly, I need to apply some design.}
