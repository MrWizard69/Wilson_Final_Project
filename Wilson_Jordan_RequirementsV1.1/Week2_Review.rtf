\f0\fs24 \cf0 	This week has been mostly spent on the redesigning of my user interface. The majority my issues in regards to the new interface had to do with consistency throughout each different layout. I have implemented the majority of the critiques given to me to fix my design and make each layout more consistent and navigational buttons look like they belong. The work I have done this weekend is to try to connect my arduino to a custom server. Everything I have seen and researched so far makes me think that it's possible. I have found many good resources on the Safari website you pointed out to me and one books I recently found talks about using the arduino and python coding. There is definitely some gems in that book. As of right now I am in the process of actually trying to connect to an old database i made using my arduino. I hope to have good new Monday!}
