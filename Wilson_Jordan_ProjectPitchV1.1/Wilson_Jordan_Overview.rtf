\f0\fs24 \cf0 	The app I'm trying to build is a smart house prototype. For this prototype I want to focus mainly on the lights. I want to make the lights to be able to sense movement and turn on when someone enters the room but also give control to the user with a web app to deem whether the lights should be on or off.\
	The most significant critique that has been presented to me in regards to design is to fix the boarders around the buttons. I wanted to make the boarders around the buttons different than the buttons so I made the boarders more square. I also made the navigation a lighter shade of blue to differentiate them from the rest of the interface. \
	The things I have been working on this week is to make a basic layout for my app and have made slight changes to it. I have also looked in to making a new more "modern" design using photos to help illustrate the different rooms. I have also done extensive research on the different technologies required to fulfill my project requirements and also in the code required to make it work.}
